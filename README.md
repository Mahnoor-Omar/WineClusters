# WineClusters
An unsupervised learning project exploring clustering techniques on the Wine dataset using K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering. The project analyzes data structure, applies feature scaling, visualizes natural groupings, compares clustering results using two features versus all features, and highlights centroid behavior and cluster separation.
